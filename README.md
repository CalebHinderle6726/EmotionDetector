# EmotionDetector
*Emotion detection network using TensorFlow*

# Overview
An emotion detecting neural network that uses a combination of CNN and Transformer network models to predict the emotion of a face within an image.

# How to run
Add a folder called 'data' to the src folder and within it put folders for each emotion with images inside of them. Update the output of the network to match the number of subfolders added within data. Make sure that each emotion folder is named different from one another, they do not necessarily need to match the emotion.
